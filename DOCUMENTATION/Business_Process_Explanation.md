The Integrated Insurance Services Project models the full insurance workflow using BPMN to ensure efficient, transparent, and automated management of customer, policy, payment, and claim activities. The process begins when a customer registers and selects an insurance policy. The insurance administrator records customer information and assigns the chosen policy. Once assigned, the MIS automatically calculates the required premium and sets the policy status to “Pending Payment.”

When the customer pays, the finance officer validates the transaction and records it in the system. PL/SQL triggers automatically activate the policy and generate a receipt. The system also performs periodic checks to update policy status to “Expired” when the end date is reached.

Customers can submit claims, which the claims officer evaluates and either approves, rejects, or requests additional details. The MIS automatically updates the claim status and calculates approved amounts.

Swimlane diagrams visually separate responsibilities among customers, administrators, finance officers, claims officers, and the automated MIS system. Decision points, such as payment validation and claim approval, are clearly shown. The proposed MIS improves accuracy, speeds up service delivery, and reduces manual errors. It also enables advanced analytics related to customer behavior, claim trends, and revenue monitoring.
