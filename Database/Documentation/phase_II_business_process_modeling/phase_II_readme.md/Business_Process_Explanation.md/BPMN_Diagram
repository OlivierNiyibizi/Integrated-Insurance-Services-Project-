The Integrated Insurance Services Project models the essential workflow of an insurance company by organizing operations into clearly defined business processes supported by a PL/SQL-based MIS. The scope includes customer registration, policy assignment, premium payment, policy activation, renewal, expiration management, and insurance claim processing. The MIS replaces manual, paper-based operations with automated validation, centralized data handling, and real-time workflow updates.

The main stakeholders include customers, insurance administrators, finance officers, claims officers, and the MIS/database system. Customers initiate the process by registering and selecting a policy. The insurance administrator records customer details and assigns policies. Once assigned, the MIS automatically calculates premiums and changes policy status to “Pending Payment.”

After payment, the finance officer validates the transaction and stores it in the database. PL/SQL triggers immediately activate the policy, generate receipts, and perform scheduled background checks for policy expiration.

If a customer submits a claim, it is received and reviewed by the claims officer, who approves, rejects, or requests more details. The MIS automatically updates claim status and calculates approved compensation.

The BPMN swimlane diagram visually separates responsibilities across the actors, showing how information flows from one role to another. Decision points highlight payment verification, claim approval, and automated actions.

This business process significantly improves the organization's efficiency by reducing manual errors, automating repeated tasks, increasing transparency, strengthening data integrity, and enabling analytics such as claims trends, revenue reports, customer segmentation, and policy performance insights.
